# Feedback
The course was a good coverage of mobile development covering react native, expo cli, android modules, api usage and much more.
In my opinion the course gives a good level of understding aboput mobile app development. The website is nicely laig out, instructons are clear and all the information about the course is laid out clearly. The moodle page is quite empty, missing even the email of the teacher. I complete the course virtually and had no problem doing so.
Workload is fine, aiming for a lower grade, in my opinion some of the excersises with less (0) instructions were a lot steeper n difficulty and required a lot more time than the rest.
The course is a solid 4, i'd prefer clearer instructuions on som of the exercises.
# Self-evaluation
I didn't keep a log of time spent overall, but a painful amout went into exercises i havent completed and the initial getting things in working order was quite tough.
Npm react dependencies creatd a lot of problems. I've only completed some of the more basic instructed exercises and i'm not leaving the course with the best 
understanding of the topic, but at least i have a surface level understanding and the knowledge to configure any fuure projects with a lot less hassel. I can make and 
export quite basic apps and web services, know how to use basic react native features, hooks and some 3rd party api's. I've hit the basic requrement, so a 1 will be fair.
